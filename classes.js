// No.1 You are working on a web application for a car rental company. They want to keep track
// of their car inventory and rental information. Your task is to create a JavaScript class or
// function constructor for representing cars in their inventory and another one for
// representing rental information.
// Requirements:
// 1) Create a Car class or function constructor that has the following properties:
// a. make (string): The make of the car, e.g., "Toyota".
// b. model (string): The model of the car, e.g., "Camry".
// c. year (number): The year the car was manufactured, e.g., 2020.
// d. isAvailable (boolean): Indicates if the car is currently available for rent.
// The Car class or function constructor should also have a method called
// toggleAvailability that changes the isAvailable property to its opposite value (true to
// false, false to true)


function Car(make,model,year,isAvailable){
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    this.isAvailable = isAvailable;

    this.toggleAvailablity = ()=>{
        if(this.isAvailable==this.isAvailable){
            console.log("Car available")
        }
        else if(this.isAvailable!=this.isAvailable){
            console.log("Car not available")
        }
        else{
            console.log("Invalid entry")
        }
    }
}
const toyota = new Car("Toyota","Camry",2020,true);
console.log({toyota})
toyota.toggleAvailablity()


// 2) Create a Rental class or function constructor that has the following properties:
// ● car (Car object): The car that has been rented.
// ● renterName (string): The name of the person who rented the car.
// ● rentalStartDate (Date object): The start date of the rental period.
// ● rentalEndDate (Date object): The end date of the rental period.
// The Rental class or function constructor should also have a method called
// calculateRentalDuration that returns the rental duration in days.
function Rental (car, renterName, rentalStartDate, rentalEndDate){
        this.car = car;
        this.renterName = renterName;
        this.rentalStartDate = new Date(rentalStartDate);
        this.rentalEndDate = new Date(rentalEndDate);
    

    this.calculateRentalDuration=()=> {
        const hoursPerDay =  60 * 24;
        return (this.rentalEndDate - this.rentalStartDate) / hoursPerDay;
    }
}
const benz = new Car("Benz", "Camry", 2020, true);
const rental = new Rental(benz, "Nancy", "2024-03-01", "2024-04-01");
const duration = rental.calculateRentalDuration();
console.log(`you have to pay ${duration}`)



// You are building a simple quiz app that contains multiple-choice questions. 
//Your task is to create two JavaScript classes: Question and Quiz. 
//The Question class will represent individual questions, and the Quiz class will manage a collection of questions and the user's progress. 
// 1. Create a Question class with the following properties: 
// ● text(string): The text of the question. 
// ● options(array): An array containing the multiple-choice options.
//   ● correctAnswer(string): The correct answer to the question. 
// The Question class should also have a method called checkAnswer that takes a 
//user's answer as a parameter and returns true if the answer is correct and false otherwise. 

class Question {
    constructor(text, options, correctAnswer) {
        this.text = text; 
        this.options = options; 
        this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer; 
    }

    checkAnswer(answer) {
        if(this.correctAnswer===this.correctAnswer){
            console.log("True")
        }
        else if(this.correctAnswer!==this.correctAnswer){
            console.log("False")

// Create a Quiz class with the following properties: 
// ● questions(array):An array of Question objects. 
// ● currentQuestionIndex(number): The index of the current question in the questions array. 
// ● score(number): The user’s current score. 
// The Quiz class should have the following methods: 
// ● addQuestion: Takes a Question object as a parameter and adds it to the questions array. 
// ● nextQuestion: Advances to the next question in the quiz by incrementing the currentQuestionIndex. 
// ● submitAnswer: Takes a user's answer as a parameter,
